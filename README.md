*In this picture I tasked myself to find the total number of cities within the country to provide a baseline for further analysis using the "Select Count" syntax.*

*I was then interested in identifying the country with the highest life expectancy, since this information would be crucial for prioritising healthcare resources and interventions.*

*Using the "LIKE" Syntax I was able to compile all the cities around the world which start with "New"*

*Using the "BETWEEN" & "AND" Syntax i was able to identify cities with populations ranging between 500,000 and 1 million*

*With discovery of the "ORDER BY" Syntax I was able to create an ascending list of all the countries in an alphabetic order*
